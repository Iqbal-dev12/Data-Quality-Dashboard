# 🧠 Data Quality Dashboard  

A **Full-Stack + Data Analysis** project designed to **monitor, visualize, and improve dataset integrity** in real-time.  
Built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and an interactive **Streamlit** frontend — this dashboard empowers data professionals to identify and resolve data quality issues quickly and efficiently.

> ⚙️ **Note:** The live backend (hosted on Railway) was part of a trial deployment and is currently inactive.  
> The application runs **perfectly on localhost**, where all backend and frontend features function as intended.
